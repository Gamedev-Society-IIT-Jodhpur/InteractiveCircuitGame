SharpCircuit
=======

This is a C# port of Paul Falstad's excellent [circuit simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) applet. 

Most of the circuit elements are untested. Initial testing suggests that the majority of the circuits work exactly as they did in the applet, but until further notice, your mileage may vary.

Licence: MIT/Boost C++

**DISCLAIMER**

This project is rated 'H' for hobbyist, I am not an electrical engineer! The tests in this project compare the output of the simulation to values extracted from falstad's original applet, they have not been independently verified for mathematical or experimental rigour.

## ToDo

- Test everything!
- Is there a better way to handle elements resizing their lead array?
- Is there a simpler way to model node relationships?.
- Refactor voltage elements
- Remove empty classes

Testing priority:
Voltage waves, SweepElm, Chips
